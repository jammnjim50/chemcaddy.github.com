## Contact

I am open to interesting and fun consulting gigs, short-term contracts,
workshops and any exciting projects working with nice people **starting in
2014**. If you think you have something we can work together on then [get in
touch](mailto:harry@csswizardry.com).

Please note that I get a _lot_ of email, so it may take me a while to get back
to you. I do try and reply to everyone, no matter how long it might take, but I
do also try and prioritise the order in which I respond: client and work-related
emails first, then speaking requests, and then general requests for help and
advice.

If I do seem to be taking a while to respond, I would not be at all offended if
you tweeted at me, or sent me a follow-up email, to remind me to reply.

## Colophon

CSS Wizardry makes use of many great tools and services; tools and services that
make my life as a developer much, much simpler.

CSS Wizardry is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an open source static
site generator. This is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and built on top of
[inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss). inuitcss is a free, open-source,
Sass-based, OOCSS framework with a strong focus on performance, scalability, and
a small footprint. This is then built into [ITCSS](http://itcss.io), a
proprietary CSS architecture of mine which is designed to aid the growth and
maintainability of CSS projects.

The font used is [Open Sans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sans), and is
served via [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). The icons are from the
[Iconic](https://useiconic.com/) icon system. The photograph used on the
homepage’s masthead is of me speaking at [DotYork](http://dotyork.com/), and was
taken by [Jim Poyner](http://jimpoyner.co.uk/).

Responsive testing was made possible by [Finch](https://meetfinch.com/), an
incredible tool for exposing local dev sites to the open internet.

CSS Wizardry’s roadmap and task list are viewable on [a public Trello
board](https://trello.com/b/5vYEHwrP/csswizardry-com), and all of the code that
powers it can be found [on
GitHub](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry.github.com). Feel free to
take a look round, but please don’t steal anything.

I chose the name <i>CSS Wizardry</i> when I was 17 years old. It’s a decision
I’m having to live with…
