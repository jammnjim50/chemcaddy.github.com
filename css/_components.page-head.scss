 * 2) A masthead that has a fluid-height (becoming fixed after a certain point)
 *    which has a large background image, and some supporting text.

 * The regular page-head is incredibly simple, but the masthead version has some
 * slightly intermingled dependency with the wrapper that lives inside it.

/**
 * Large site headers act more like mastheads. They have a faux-fluid-height
 * which is controlled by the wrapping element inside it.
 *
 * 1. Mastheads will typically have dark backgrounds, so we need to make sure
 *    the contrast is okay. This value is subject to change as the background
 *    image changes.
 * 2. We need to delegate a lot of the masthead’s layout to its wrapper element
 *    rather than the masthead itself: it is to this wrapper that most things
 *    are positioned.
 * 3. The wrapper needs positioning context for us to lay our nav and masthead
 *    text in.
 * 4. Faux-fluid-height technique: simply create the illusion of fluid height by
 *    creating space via a percentage padding, and then position everything over
 *    the top of that. This percentage gives us a 16:9 ratio.
 * 5. When the viewport is at 758px wide, our 16:9 ratio means that the masthead
 *    is currently rendered at 480px high. Let’s…
 * 6. …seamlessly snip off the fluid feature at this height, and…
 * 7. …fix the height at 480px. This means that we should see no jumps in height
 *    as the masthead moves from fluid to fixed. This actual value takes into
 *    account the padding and the top border on the header itself.
